## 🔧 Installation

```sh
# Install from PyPI
pip install viby
# OR
uv tool install viby
```

### Alternative Installation

```sh
# Install from source with uv
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Question

```sh
yb vibe "Write a quicksort in python"
# -> Sure! Here is a quicksort algorithm implemented in **Python**:
```

### Simplified Command

```sh
yb "Write a quicksort in python"
# -> Same result as above
```

### Process Piped Content

```sh
git diff | yb vibe "Generate a commit message"
# -> Added information to the README
```

```sh
yb vibe "What is this project about?" < README.md
# -> This project is about...
```

### Generate Shell Command

```sh
yb vibe "How many lines of python code did I write?"
# -> find . -type f -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l
# -> [r]run, [e]edit, [y]copy, [c]chat, [q]quit (default: run): 
```

### Advanced Model Selection

```sh
# Use think model for complex analysis
yb --think vibe "Analyze this complex algorithm and suggest optimizations"

# Use fast model for quick responses
yb --fast vibe "Translate 'Hello, World!' to French"
```

### Shell Command Magic Integration

```sh
# List directory contents
yb vibe "$(ls) What files are in the current directory?"
# -> The current directory contains: file1.txt, file2.py, directory1/...

# Analyze Git status
yb vibe "$(git status) Which files should I commit first?"

# View code files
yb vibe "$(cat main.py) How can I improve this code?"
```

### Smart Tool Discovery

```sh
# Viby will automatically discover and use relevant tools
yb vibe "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
# -> [Viby identifies and uses weather tools]
# -> The current weather in San Francisco is 68°F and partly cloudy...

# Embedding Model Management
# First download the embedding model (required once before using embedding features)
# Embed model configurable with yb --config
yb tools embed download

# Start the embedding server (required for tool discovery)
yb tools embed start

# Check embedding server status
yb tools embed status

# Update tool embeddings from configured MCP servers
yb tools embed update

# List available tools (udpate before listing)
yb tools list

# Stop the embedding server when not needed
yb tools embed stop
```

### Automatically Use MCP Tools When Needed

```sh
yb vibe "What time is it now?"
# -> [AI uses time tool to get current time]
# -> "datetime": "2025-05-03T00:49:57+08:00"
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Viby provides a convenient keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Q) that allows you to quickly use Viby with the current command line content:

```sh
# Install the keyboard shortcuts (auto-detects your shell)
yb shortcuts

# After installation, type any command and press Ctrl+Q
help me analyze my readme file  # Now press Ctrl+Q
# -> This transforms into: yb vibe help me analyze my readme file
# -> [AI analyzes and responds to question]
```

Supported shells:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish

After installing shortcuts, you'll need to reload your shell configuration (`source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`, or equivalent) or restart your terminal for the shortcuts to take effect.

## Command Structure

Viby uses a simple command structure:

```
yb [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [ARGS]...
```

Main commands:
- `yb [prompt]` - Ask a question (alias for `yb vibe "your question"`; **recommended**)
- `yb vibe "your question"` - Ask a question (default command for questions)
- `yb --think vibe "complex question"` - Use the think model for deeper analysis
- `yb --fast vibe "simple question"` - Use the fast model for quick responses
- `yb history` - Manage interaction history
- `yb tools` - Manage tool-related commands
- `yb shortcuts` - Install keyboard shortcuts

Use `yb --help` to see all available commands and options.

## Configuration

Viby reads configuration from `~/.config/viby/config.yaml`. You can set the model, parameters, and MCP options here.

### Interactive Configuration

Use the configuration wizard to set up your preferences:

```sh
yb --config
```

This allows you to configure:

- API endpoint and key
- Model
- Temperature and token settings
- MCP tools enablement
- Interface language
- Embedding model settings

### MCP Server Configuration

Viby supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for extended capabilities. MCP configurations are stored in `~/.config/viby/mcp_servers.json`.
